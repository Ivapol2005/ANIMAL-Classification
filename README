This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that identifies whether an image contains a cat or a dog and determines its breed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model is integrated to process textual data written by user and writes if it mentions animal breed correctly.

Classifies images of cats and dogs into 37 different breeds based on the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset
Uses a pre-trained NLP model (en_core_web_sm) for text analysis
Employs CNN for image classification (cat_dog_classifier.h5)
Object detection support via VOC dataset annotations

The project utilizes the following libraries:
    Deep Learning & ML: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, numpy
    Computer Vision: OpenCV (cv2), matplotlib
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): spaCy (en_core_web_sm)
    Data Processing: os, xml.etree.ElementTree
    Fuzzy Matching: thefuzz
    
Install Dependencies
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib spacy thefuzz scikit-learn
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Run the Model:
python3 pipeline.py

Train new model:
python3 create_model.py

model is saved as cat_dog_classifier.h5
